# we-love-movies-project
Backend Capstone Project

cors() requests are allowed for all routes in each router file. Did not enable all CORS requests since I was planning to upgrade this project at the later stage.

This project could use more validations, but since this was not mentioned in the requirements - I'm leaving it as is for now.
